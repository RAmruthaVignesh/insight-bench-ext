      "reasoning": "This pattern mimics monthly maintenance periods or updates that typically elevate incident urgency, priority, and impact due to known systemic changes. Real-world organizations often have such scheduled activities, creating clustered high-priority incidents.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Affects 'Urgency and Priority Discrepancy' and 'Incident Escalation Rate' by concentrating high-urgency cases, possibly leading to escalations if not managed timely.",
      "benchmark_value": "Tests model's ability to identify seasonal patterns and differentiate them from random anomalies. Challenges the model to learn temporal associations and determine if high urgency is justified."
