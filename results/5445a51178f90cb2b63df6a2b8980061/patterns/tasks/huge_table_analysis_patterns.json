      "pattern": "Introduce periodic large-scale incidents (spikes in 'High' priority) affecting 'ITSM Engineering' Assignment group, occurring every 3 months with peaks in 'Opened' dates and grouped around certain 'Configuration item'. This periodic event causes a surge in the 'Incident state' being 'New' and increased 'Reassignment count'.",
