      "reasoning": "In real-world data, more urgent or complex incidents tend to bounce between teams as more expertise is sought to resolve them.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Influences 'Time to resolution distribution' by increasing resolution time for critical incidents with higher reassignment counts.",
      "benchmark_value": "Challenges the model to understand the relationship between incident priority and handling dynamics within teams, important for realistic cluster interpretation."

      "benchmark_value": "Assesses the model's capability to cluster logs based on agent performance and identify outliers or particularly effective agents."
