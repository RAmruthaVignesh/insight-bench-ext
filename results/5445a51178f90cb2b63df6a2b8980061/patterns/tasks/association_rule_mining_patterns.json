      "pattern": "Introduction of a temporal anomaly where incidents opened during a specific month (e.g., October 2024) tend to have higher 'Priority'.",

        "Opened",
        "Priority"
      ],
      "reasoning": "Identifying whether temporal events coincide with changes in incident priority can reveal seasonal or periodic patterns in the data that might affect operational focus areas.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "This pattern is likely to increase the support and confidence metrics for rules that associate specific times with certain priorities, impacting the discovery of temporal correlation rules.",
      "benchmark_value": "It tests the model's ability to detect temporal dependencies and conditional behaviors, such as the influence of specific time periods on priority levels."

      "pattern": "A category-based split where incidents with 'Network' category disproportionately affect 'On Hold' state due to dependency on external resources.",

        "Category",
        "State"
      ],
      "reasoning": "Network-related issues often require external coordination, thus increasing the likelihood of being placed on hold. Mimicking this dependency benchmarks the model's sensitivity to real-world category-state dependencies.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "This pattern affects rule lift and confidence, particularly those involving 'Network' category and 'On Hold' state. It challenges the model's capacity to link organizational factors (like category dependencies) to state outcomes.",
      "benchmark_value": "It enables testing on how well the model identifies operational hindrances tied to specific categories, useful for process improvement insights."

        "Resolved by",
        "Priority",

      "relevance_to_kpi": "It impacts rule confidence and lift involved with 'Resolved by' and 'Priority', examining how system administration influence shifts to higher urgency resolutions over time.",
      "benchmark_value": "Tests models on their ability to detect changes in association strengths due to shifts in organizational roles and responsibilities."
