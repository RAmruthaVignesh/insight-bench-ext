This reflects real-world scenarios where the workload is lower during off-peak hours, potentially leading to quicker resolutions.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Affects 'Frequent Itemsets' by potentially creating associations between 'Opened' times and quicker 'Resolve time', affecting the computation of 'Support' and 'Confidence' for these associations.",

      "relevance_to_kpi": "Influences 'Confidence' and 'Lift' by increasing the co-occurrence of 'High' impact, 'On Hold' state, and high 'Reopen count', necessitating stronger inference mechanisms to identify underlying dependencies.",
      "benchmark_value": "Encourages robust benchmarking of the model's capacity to uncover deeper interdependencies and conditional trends across different fields, posing challenges in detecting co-occurring patterns amidst varying data complexities."
