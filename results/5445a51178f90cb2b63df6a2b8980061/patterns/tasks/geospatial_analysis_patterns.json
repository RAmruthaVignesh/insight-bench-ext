      "reasoning": "This pattern simulates real-world scenarios where certain categories, like 'Network', experience seasonal surges, for example, during certain times of the year or during specific events. Mimicking such trends helps assess how models deal with seasonality, which is common in many business domains.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Affects 'Incident Volume by Location' and 'Impact of Incident by Category' by showing spikes in incidence volume and potentially impacting resource allocation decisions.",

      "reasoning": "A sudden change in how 'Critical' priority incidents are managed, possibly due to policy changes or strategic decision-making, can lead to new operational behaviors. This pattern helps evaluate a model's capability to detect and adapt to shifts in process management.",
