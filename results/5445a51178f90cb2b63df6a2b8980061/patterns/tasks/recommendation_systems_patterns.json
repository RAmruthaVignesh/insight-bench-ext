      "reasoning": "This pattern simulates a common real-world scenario where a system breakdown or a security breach causes a spike in incident reports. Resolving incidents quickly is critical but becomes challenging, testing the system's robustness under stress.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Affects the 'Resolution Time' by increasing it during the spike period while possibly influencing 'Incident Priority Handling' as urgent incidents might be delayed due to the backlog.",
      "benchmark_value": "Tests models on handling priority during high-load situations and assessing how well they differentiate between high and low-priority incidents under stress."

      "reasoning": "Differences in group efficiencies are realistic as certain groups or individuals may have different skill sets or workloads, leading to varied customer outcomes.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Directly impacts 'Customer Satisfaction', especially highlighting which groups or individuals may correlate with higher or lower satisfaction levels.",
      "benchmark_value": "Enables analysis and benchmarking of recommendation models in understanding which team or assignee optimizes customer satisfaction best and advising on potential reassignments."

      "reasoning": "High-impact incidents might cause non-critical subsequent incidents to be re-prioritized due to resource reallocation or strategic focus shifts.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Affects 'Incident Priority Handling' as incidents with delayed impact might cause priority reassessment, causing prior 'less critical' incidents to be upgraded.",
      "benchmark_value": "Tests the model's ability to recognize and adjust recommendations based on evolving incident dynamics and understand strategic adjustments in resource allocation under shifting priorities."
