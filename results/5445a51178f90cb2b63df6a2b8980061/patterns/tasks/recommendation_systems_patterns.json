      "reasoning": "A common real-world occurrence is that IT systems and services experience higher loads during peak business hours (e.g., 9 AM - 5 PM, Monday to Friday), leading to longer resolution times. Injecting this pattern can simulate a realistic operational bottleneck.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Affects 'Average Resolve Time' by potentially inflating it during peak hours, providing insight into how well a recommendation system can advise preemptive resource allocation or incident prioritization.",

      "reasoning": "This pattern involves frequent changes in the 'Resolution code' tied to specific 'Category' values reflecting policy updates or new solutions for common issues (e.g., 'Network' incidents resolved with a 'Known error' code). This mimics organizational learning or shifts in problem-solving approaches.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Influences 'Incident Reassignment Rate', as effective category-based resolution strategies should reduce the need for incident reassignment.",
      "benchmark_value": "Evaluates a recommendation system\u2019s effectiveness in leveraging learnings from past resolutions to inform future recommendations on resource assignment or procedural adherence."
