It provides a realistic test of a model's ability to handle and identify temporal anomalies and workload management.",

      "reasoning": "Priority may influence resolution speed differently depending on when the incident is opened. For example, '1 - Critical' priority incidents may be resolved faster during business hours than outside them, reflecting resource availability.",

      "benchmark_value": "Challenges the model's segmentation ability to differentiate temporal impacts on resolution based on priority, demanding nuanced understanding of temporal-categorical interactions."
