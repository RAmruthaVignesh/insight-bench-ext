For example, incidents from '33 East Midland Avenue, Paramus, NJ' might have unusually long 'Business duration' during winter months due to possible weather impacts, while other locations show normal trends. This simulates real-world scenarios of location-based operational challenges.",

This pattern mirrors real life occurrences where certain categories can experience seasonal loads.",

      "benchmark_value": "This evaluates the PCA's sensitivity to shifts in correlation structures conditioned by categorical escalations, challenging models to adjust components reflecting induced dependencies."
