This simulates the real-world scenario where newly assigned individuals may take longer to resolve incidents due to a lack of familiarity with the specific case.",

      "reasoning": "Inject a seasonal pattern where certain months see a surge in high priority incidents. For example, during the months near holidays, such as November and December, incidents with '1 - Critical' priority increase by 30%. This simulates real-world trends where key business periods experience increased demand or stress on systems.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Affects Priority Change Frequency and SLA Compliance Rate as higher priority incidents may demand faster resolution but also risk more SLA breaches due to volume.",

      "relevance_to_kpi": "Directly impacts Incident Resolution Time as the delays inflate the time needed for final closure, affecting SLA Compliance.",
      "benchmark_value": "Challenges the model to detect and adapt to systematic delays tied to human resource bottlenecks, improving incident management strategies."
