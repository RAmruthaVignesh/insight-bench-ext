      "reasoning": "This pattern mimics real-world scenarios where specific times of the year, such as the end-of-year holiday season, result in an increased number of incidents reported due to higher usage and change freezes. Typically, these incidents are of higher urgency and priority as they impact more users or critical systems.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Affects 'High Priority Incidents' by increasing the number of incidents that need immediate attention during this period, potentially skewing the importance of related features.",
      "benchmark_value": "Tests the model's ability to accurately identify temporal patterns and seasonal impacts on incident priority, influencing feature importance rankings."
